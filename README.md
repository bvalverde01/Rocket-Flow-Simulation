# Rocket-Flow-Simulation

This is an independent research project that is being currently being worked on.
The scope of this project is as follows:
-Oxidizers
  -LOX
-Fuel
  -RP1, LH2, LCH4
-Goals
  -Calculate the size of the CD nozzle for each F.O.
  -Measure the thrust, Ve, Isp, effeciency for each
  -Study the subsonic flow in the chamber and the supersonic flow at the nozzle entrance and exit
  -Analyze performance at different altitudes and pressures.

This is going to be accomplished through the following steps
1. Calculate the needed parameters for sizing of the rocket nozzle.
2. 3D model rocket nozzles in SolidWorks.
3. Transfer the geometry into ANSYS Fluent or OpenFOAM.
4. Simulated flows.
5. Write a program in python that take output data and sorts and displays useful data and graphs.
